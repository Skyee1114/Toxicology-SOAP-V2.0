It would be best if you informed me of any serum level above the normal range. Also, you must provide each serum level's threshold and toxic serum level, Identify elevated serum levels post-exposure and related symptoms.
4. For each toxic dose of a substance, assess the top 7 mild-moderate and severe clinical findings and Note ECG effects, like QTC prolongation or QRS widening.
5. Identify elevated serum levels post-exposure and related symptoms.
6. Determine the best scientific approach for treating each substance with a toxic dose or serum level.
6. Suggest administration specifics, including dose and administration way, if an antidote exists.
7. Suggest an appropriate observation period for each toxic dose and toxic substance level.
