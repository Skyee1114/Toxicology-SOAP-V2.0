Use the conditions below if the patient is associated with some of the substances below:
Toxic serum level or dose(mg) or dose per kg of body weight) of substances:

Toxic serum level thresholds:
- Toxic Serum Ethanol (ETHOH) = over 100 mg/dL
- Toxic Urine Arsenic = over 100 mcg/L
- Toxic Serum Phenobarbital = from 3 to 40 mcg/ml (lethargy and ataxia), from 60 to 150 mcg/ml (coma), 150 mcg/ml (hypotension and coma)
- Toxic Serum level of Valproic Acid (VPA) level = over 100 mcg/ml
- Toxic Serum level of Carbamazepine = over 12 mg/L
- Toxic Serum level of Theophylline = over 40 mcg/ml (chronic), 80 mcg/ml (acute)
- Toxic Serum level of Lithium = over 1.5 mEq/L (chronic), 4 mEq/L (acute)
- Toxic Serum level of Lead = over 5 mcg /dL, (over 40 mcg /dL, usually needs chelator treatment)
- Toxic Serum level of Digoxin = over 2 ng/mL (acute on chronic or chronic), 10 ng/mL (acute), 3 mg (adult and acute), 0.1 mg/kg (children)
- Toxic serum level of Phenytoin = over 20 to 50 µg/mL (mild to moderate), 50 µg/mL (severe), 20 mg/kg
-Toxic serum level of Methanol = over 25 mg/dL
-Toxic serum level of Ethylene Glycol = over 25 mg/dL
- Toxic Serum level of ASA (aspirin)= over 30 mg/dL 
-For evaluating acetaminophen level (APAP LEVEL): Determine the thresholds for toxicity based    on time post ingestion that you can find it in the Toxsoap, consider time post ingestion as time and use this formula to calculate the toxic APAP level for that time
    if 4 <= time <= 24:
        line200 = round (math.exp(5.298317 - ((time - 4) * 0.1732868)))
        line150 = round(line200 - (0.25 * line200))
If the APAP level in the Toxsoap> line 200, the APAP LEVEL is in toxic range and if it is >line150, it is potentially in toxic range.

Toxic doses of substances:
- Toxic dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol, APAP) = over 200 mg/kg (acute), 150 mg/kg (acute on chronic)

- Toothpaste or fluoride= Find the type of fluoride in the toothpaste from: Sodium fluoride, Sodium monofluorophosphate, Stannous fluoride, or Fluoride ion. Then ask for the concentration percentage and amount ingested in ounces. Calculate the dose in mg/kg using the appropriate formula based on fluoride type. If Sodium fluoride, use (Concentration * Amount * 128) / weight. If Sodium monofluorophosphate, use (Concentration * Amount * 37) / weight. If Stannous fluoride, use (Concentration * Amount * 69) / weight. If Fluoride ion, use (Concentration * Amount * 218) / weight. If the final dose is greater than 3 mg/kg, print that the dose is toxic and advise going to the ER.

-Salicylate= Evaluate if any substance is salicylate (evaluate brand names of salicylates as well) if you find a salicylate in the Toxsoap: your tasks are: look for salicylate form( solid or liquid form).
If solid, get amount and units and calculate dose in mg.
If liquid, get amount, units, concentration% and calculate dose in mg/kg.
You should determine the ACF value (You should proceed with an assumed value of ACFS) for the specific salicylate in the Toxsoap. Then Calculate ACF-corrected dose by multiplying dose by ACF.
Print ACF-corrected dose.
Predict toxicity level (not toxic, mild-moderate, severe) by comparing ACF-corrected dose to toxicity thresholds.
Print toxicity prediction.
Find ASA serum level in the Toxsoap.
Check if ASA level exceeds 30 mg/dL toxic range.
Print message if ASA toxic range detected.

Note:
If a substance is in the form of liquid, you should calculate the mg/kg . 
You should use these steps to calculate the dose(mg/kg):

convert_to_ml: Convert units like oz, sips, tabs to ml
concentration_to_mg_ml: Convert percentage concentration to mg/ml
get_amount_and_concentration:
Convert input amount to ml
Convert input concentration% to mg/ml
Calculate total mg by multiplying amount_in_ml and concentration_mg_ml
Return amount_in_ml, concentration_mg_ml, total_mg
